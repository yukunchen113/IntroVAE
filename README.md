# IntroVAE

## About this Project
This project implements the IntroVAE.

Please see my post [here on the analysis of IntroVAEs](https://yukunchen113.github.io/project/2019/03/03/Variational-Autoencoder.html)

## How to use:
Please pull my utils repo, and add it to your python path. The functions there are used.

The model training is contained in main.py, the parameters are in params.py and the predictions folder contains saved images during training. The models.py file contains the model for the VAE

The model files are called model.ckpt
